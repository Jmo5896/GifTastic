Gif-Tastic:
One Paragraph of project description goes here
        The main goal of this project was to build a fun and simple app 
    that helped me learn how to make api calls and how to manipulate gif's.  
    I started with a rigid bootstrap grid system but then switched to a 
    flexbox style which fixed a lot of run over issues I was having.  Again 
    pretty simple app but it's all front-end so it can run straight off of 
    Github and isn't all that difficult to whip up.

Getting Started:
        I didn't use any real key protection so if you clone it you are good 
    to go.  If you want to use your personal API key go to:
    https://developers.giphy.com/ .

Built With:
    HTML
    CSS
    Bootstrap
    Javascript
    jQuery
