Gif-Tastic:
        The main goal of this project was to build a fun and simple app 
    that helped me learn how to make api calls and how to manipulate gif's.  
    I started with a rigid bootstrap grid system but then switched to a 
    flexbox style which fixed a lot of run over issues I was having.  Again 
    pretty simple app but it's all front-end so it can run straight off of 
    Github and isn't all that difficult to whip up.

Getting Started:
        I didn't use any real key protection so if you clone it you are good 
    to go.  If you want to use your personal API key go to:
    https://developers.giphy.com/ .
    
    To Use App:
        1. clone repository or click the link: https://jmo5896.github.io/GifTastic/
        2. enter the category you want to look for in the search bar then click the "add" button
        3. To see the top 12 memes of the category you just added, click the button with said category on it.
        4. refreshing the page will reset the available buttons to the defaults (funny, fail, cat).
